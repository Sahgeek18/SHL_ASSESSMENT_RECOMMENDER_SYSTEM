#SHL Test Solution Recommender  

This Streamlit app uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to recommend relevant SHL test solutions based on a natural language query or job description. It leverages Hugging Face embeddings for document retrieval and LLaMA3 (via Ollama) for answer generation.
This repositroy contains a working streamlit application and a jupyter notebook on google colab along with the scraped data set and required libraries.
